# What the software does

The software Coding Club Management System(CCMS) provides an interface for coding contest organizers, recruiters, and lab examiners
to conduct coding tests in the offline environment.
Here, the offline environment refers to a personal network which is simply created using wifi-hotspots, routers, and hubs.
We don't need an internet connection for conducting contests in this software.
It compiles and runs the code in various languages like python,c,c++, etc., without installing them on our system.

# Why the software is useful
This CCMS is useful not only for its ease of access but also for its maintenance.
Any type of coding-contests which rely purely on programming languages can use this software.
Like hackerrank, hackerearth, etc., sites this software do not need an internet connection.
Lab examiners can use this software for conducting lab exams and it gives the results instantaneously.
Recruiters from various software companies can also use this software for their coding rounds.
